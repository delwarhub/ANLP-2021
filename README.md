# ANLP-2021

Overview of the Contents
We will mainly follow the major textbook in our field, Jurafsky & Martin's "Speech and Language Processing". The authors are currently preparing the 3rd edition, and while they are doing this, the draft version is freely available. We will use this mostly (denoted by JM3 below). The plan is to cover chapters 2 -- 9 and 12 -- 16.

* Recently, another textbook that aims at a general introduction has come out, Jacob Eisenstein's "Introduction to Natural Language Processing". This takes a somewhat more CS / ML-inspired approach, and can be used as further background reading. (The free PDF that you will find online is the pre-final draft missing some corrections; we have a couple of paper copies available in the library.)

* Even more recently, and indicating what an active field this is, yet another textbook has come out, Zhang & Teng's "Natural Language Processing: A Machine Learning Perspective". This, as the subtitle indicates, comes at the problems even more clearly from a machine learning-perspective; it can also be used as further background reading. We have a couple of paper copies available in the library as well.

* Finally, if you don't have a background in linguistics, you will be taking the "Foundations in Linguistics" class. For reference, there are also two very useful "linguistic fundamentals" books (see below), that you can download for free when accessing the links below through the uni network / VPN.
